## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Challenge 1

Import dataset
```{r}

f <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2021-datasets/main/darwin.txt'
```

load the last chapter into a character vector where each element is a paragraph from the chapter
```{r}
last_chapter = read.delim(f,sep = "\n")
last_chapter
```

calculate and print out how many paragraphs there are in the chapter (do not count the chapter title as a paragraph)

```{r}
paragraph = last_chapter$CHAPTER.XV..RECAPITULATION.AND.CONCLUSION.
length(paragraph)
```

Print out the element that is the 34th paragraph from the chapter
```{r}
last_chapter [[34,1]]
```

Split the vector into a new chapter comprising of a vector of 1 word character strings

```{r}
library(strings)

split <- str_split(paragraph, ' ')
split <- unlist (split)
split <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", split)

```

How many unique words are there?
  
```{r}
  T= table(split)
length(T) #2059 

```

Could also use a frequency table

```{r}
freq <- sort(table (split))
View(freq)

```

Most commonly used word

```{r}
names(T [T==max(T)]) #the
```

Number of words used exactly 1 time

```{r}
length(which(T==1)) #1072

```

Number of words used 5 or more times

```{r}

length(which( T >= 5)) #369
```

Split the entire last paragraph into a new variable, final_quote

```{r}
final_quote <-last_chapter[56, ]
final_quote
```

Split this quote into a new vector, split_quote, comprising a vector of 1-word character strings

```{r}
split_quote <- str_split(final_quote, ' ')
split_quote <- unlist(final_quote)
split_quote <- gsub ("[[:punct:]]", "", final_quote)
```

Extract every third element from this vector, assign them to a new vector, every_third, and print out the new vector. 
```{r}
every_third <- split_quote[seq(1, length(split_quote), 3)]
print(every_third)
```
Rearrange the elements of the vector every_third into reverse alphabetical order and print it out again
```{r}
every_third <- sort(every_third, decreasing=TRUE)
every_third
```
Challenge 2

Use the function c() to create a vector with the average high temperatures in January for Beijing, Lagos, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan, and Toronto, which are 35, 88, 42, 84, 81, and 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Call the object t

```{r}
t <- c(35, 88, 42,84,81, 30 )
```

Create a vector with the city names and call the object city

```{r}
city <- c('Beijing', 'Lagos', 'Paris', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'San Juan', 'Toronto')
```

Use names() function and the objects defined above to associate the temperature data with its corresponding city 

```{r}
names(t) <- city
```

Use the [ and : opererators to access the temperature of the first three cities on the list

```{r}
t[1:3]
```

Use the [ operator to access the temperatures of Paris and San Juan
```{r}
t["Paris"]
t["San Juan"]
```

Challenge 3

Create a 8 row by 20 column matrix named m1 consisting of integers arranged in descending order from 159 to 0. Fill your matrix column-wise

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(c(159:0), nrow= 8, ncol=20)
```

Use single bracket notation, extract and print the element in row 5, column 2 

```{r}
m1[5,2]
```

Use single bracket notation, extract and print the contents of rows 5 to 7 of the matrix

```{r}
m1[5:7, ]
```

Use single bracket notation, extract the contents of (row 3, column 4) to (row 6, column 9) as a new variable, m2. 

```{r}
m2 <- m1[3:6, 4:9]
```

What is the class of this variable?
```{r}
class(m2)
```

What is the mode of this variable?
```{r}
mode(m2)
```

Challenge 4

Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5x5x4x4) named a, consisting of even integers from 2 to 800

```{r}
a <- array(seq(2, 800,2), dim=c(5, 5, 4, 4))
```

Given this matrix, what does the following return?

a[1, 1, 1, 2] # returns 202

a[2, 3, 2, ] # returns 74 274 474 674

a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3] #returns    
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]  502  512  522  532  542
[2,]  504  514  524  534  544
[3,]  506  516  526  536  546
[4,]  508  518  528  538  548
[5,]  510  520  530  540  550

Challenge 5

Create a list representing the primate taxonomy outlined.Name each internal node in the list (i.e., Superfamily and above) with the appropriate taxonomic level and name. Within each superfamily, you can use a vector to store family names (e.g., Superfamily Lorisoidea can be represented as c("Lorisidae, "Galagidae")).


```{r}
